## Features

FlameCord being a fork of Waterfall, has all its features, and some of its own, such as:

* **Exploit Fixes**: FlameCord specializes in providing better server security by fixing major exploits, performance flaws and bugs that Bungeecord already has, and that have not yet been fixed in WaterfallMC.
* **Bot Protection**: FlameCord brings swift bot protection for your Minecraft server to avoid extra CPU usage and crashes in your machines.

## Why fork Waterfall?

FlameCord was forked out of a desire for greater protection to be afforded to a Bungeecord-based proxy, which Waterfall currently cannot offer.

FlameCord will track upstream Waterfall and merge changes as needed.
